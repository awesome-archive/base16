## Deprecated

This repo has been deprecated and has been moved to [this repo](https://github.com/base16-project/base16). Development has moved to the [base16-project](https://github.com/base16-project) org. We will be accepting PRs over there (for schemes, templates, and spec changes) and continue development of base16 led by the community.

Unfortunately, because no admins of this repo are around any more, we cannot transfer this repo and are limited to a hard fork. Eventually we plan to go through the PRs and issues of the original repos, but that may take a bit of time. If you'd like to expedite the process, please open a new PR or issue against the the new repo and link back to the original.

## Original Readme

To make the above deprecation notice more visible, the original README has been moved. The previous text is still available and can be [found here](/ORIGINAL-README.md).
